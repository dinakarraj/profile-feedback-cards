                    I was an Emt for many years before i joined the bootcamp. 
                    i've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    Thr\e next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.since completing the course.i've succesfully switched carrers,

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
                    I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. 
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
